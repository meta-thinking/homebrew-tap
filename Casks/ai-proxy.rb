  caveats <<~EOS
    AI-Proxy is ad-hoc signed (no Apple notarization yet). If macOS blocks the
    first launch, either right-click the app in /Applications and choose Open,
    or run:  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/AI-Proxy.app"

    Look for the AI-Proxy window and the menu-bar icon. Not affiliated with
    Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI — it routes requests through YOUR OWN
    subscriptions (see the disclaimer in the app's License tab).
